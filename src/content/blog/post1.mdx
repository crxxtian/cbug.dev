Welcome to my very first blog post!

I'm making it my goal this new year to start creating more content rather than constantly being a consumer of content. I've long wanted to start a blog, but I held myself back for a few common reasons.

I think if I really dig into it, it was worrying that I would be judged or criticized by others, which I'm sure is a common one for first time writers. I also quite honestly had no idea what to write about. It seemed extremely daunting to just sit and figure out how to write casually. I've never written for my own enjoyment or pleasure and found that it may be a bit challenging at times for me due to the fact that my educational background never focused on such.

Nonetheless, now that I'm out of university, I want to make sure that I don't lose out on any important skills such as analytical research and long-form writing and perhaps gain some skills in creative writing. I want to make sure I do not lean on LLMs and produce real human content that others may find interesting to continue to stimulate my brain. Although LLMs do have their place for certain tasks, everything will be typed out by a human (me) on this blog.

I guess I'm working in the field now too so I can try and build my skills while also sharing my ideas. I'm starting to not worry as much about those things mentioned previously and so I've decided to start my own site where I can write about stuff I'm passionate about and develop my skills as a technical and creative author.

This site will hopefully become a consistently updated blog with real analysis, real notes, and real research. I'll be posting about recent news that I find interesting, my growing interest in macOS malware, and my journey in incident response/security operations write-ups and tales.

Unfortunately, I will not be posting any content regarding work that goes on at my day job. This site will contain after-hours security research and projects.

I may get around to doing one post a month until I get more comfortable with blogging, or depending on how busy I am I may get more done in a month.

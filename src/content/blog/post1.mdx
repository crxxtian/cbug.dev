Enterprise macOS security is less about one-off settings and more about how the platform actually works in a managed fleet. This is a baseline for people moving into macOS security at scale: what matters, why it matters, and where teams tend to get tripped up.

## The macOS security model in one page

- **Hardware root of trust:** Apple silicon (and T2 on Intel) establishes a boot chain and protects keys used for FileVault and system integrity.
- **Signed system volume (SSV):** System files are sealed and verified at boot; persistent tampering becomes noisy.
- **Code signing + notarization:** Apps are expected to be signed; notarization is a malware screening gate with real gaps and delays.
- **TCC (privacy prompts):** Access to sensitive resources is per app, per user, and policyable via MDM.
- **Sandboxing:** Many apps have least-privilege entitlements and containerized file access; security hinges on entitlements and user prompts.
- **Gatekeeper + XProtect + MRT:** Built-in runtime checks, known-malware detection, and remediation. Good hygiene, not a complete solution.

If you can explain those six items to a non-security stakeholder, you can explain most macOS security decisions.

## Must-know enterprise tooling

- **MDM (Mobile Device Management):** The control plane. Config profiles, compliance checks, and remote actions live here.
- **Declarative device management:** State-based policy enforcement. It changes how you reason about drift and remediation.
- **Endpoint Security (ES) + EDR:** ES is the Apple API, EDR is the product. Learn which ES events your EDR does and does not ship.
- **Security baselines:** CIS + vendor hardening guides are the starting point, not the end state.
- **Identity and access:** SSO, device-based conditional access, local admin rights, and auth logging matter more than you think.

## Core policies you will be asked about

- **FileVault:** Enforce encryption, escrow recovery keys, and validate real coverage (not just policy intent).
- **Updates:** Prioritize OS + security update compliance; manage deferrals and user-visible deadlines.
- **Local admin rights:** Define who gets them, how long, and how exceptions are audited.
- **TCC controls:** Approve known apps; block risky access; monitor for user-granted drift.
- **Firewall + network extensions:** Know which controls are system-level vs app-level, and who is allowed to install them.

## How attackers target macOS in enterprises

- **Credential theft:** Browser tokens, keychain prompts, and MFA fatigue patterns.
- **Abuse of built-in tools:** `osascript`, `launchctl`, `profiles`, `systemextensionsctl`, and signed-but-abused binaries.
- **Persistence:** Launch agents/daemons, login items, and configuration profiles (especially user-approved).
- **User-consent blind spots:** Social engineering around system prompts and installer packages.

This is why logging and visibility matter more than perfect prevention.

## Logs and telemetry you should learn first

- **Unified logs:** `log show` and `log stream` for time-scoped investigations.
- **Endpoint Security events:** Process, file, network, and auth events via EDR.
- **MDM state:** Inventory, profiles, compliance, and remediation history.
- **Network:** DNS, proxy, and VPN telemetry for device/user context.
- **Auth:** Local auth logs, MFA events, and identity provider audit trails.

## Build a simple practice lab

1. Enroll a test Mac in an MDM (even a free tier).
2. Enforce FileVault, updates, and a basic TCC policy for a known app.
3. Install an EDR trial and map its event types to the ES framework.
4. Generate a benign detection (like a simulated persistence item) and validate alert flow.
5. Break something on purpose (block a needed entitlement) and practice rollback.

## Suggested next steps

- Read the Apple Platform Security Guide and focus on system integrity, TCC, and ES.
- Walk through the CIS macOS Benchmark and translate controls into MDM profiles.
- Practice incident response for a real-world scenario: stolen device or suspicious login item.
- Build a one-page “how we detect this” sheet for one common macOS tradecraft technique.

Mac security is a moving target. The most valuable skill is the ability to connect platform mechanics to enterprise controls and explain tradeoffs clearly.

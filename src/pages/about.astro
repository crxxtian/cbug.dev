			<h1>about</h1>

<p>
				Started in 2026, this site was created as a personal collection of notes and writeups related to security work, 
				including incident response, detection engineering, and malware analysis. 
			</p>
<p>
				By day, I work as a Security Analyst in the financial services industry. 
				By night, I get bored and decide to make stupid blog posts. 

				<p>
				I have an interest in macOS malware and fighting off threat actors. 
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				Content on my site reflects my personal learning and experimentation. It is not affiliated
				with or representative of any employer. Some posts are incomplete or exploratory by design.

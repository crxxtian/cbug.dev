				Notes from blue-team work: incident response, SecOps, detection engineering,
				and malware analysis — with extra attention on macOS.

				Posts range from quick “here’s what I saw and what i thought about it” write-ups
				to longer deep notes. Expect practical details (commands, artifacts, log ideas).
